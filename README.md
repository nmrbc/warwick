  The project is built using Maven, so you may import it directly through 
  Eclipse as long as you have the Maven Eclipse plugin installed.
  
  Prepare the deployment using Maven's command: clean package

  Maven build will result into a WAR File placed in the /target directory. 
  Use a web server application like Tomcat to deploy the WAR file and start 
  using it.
